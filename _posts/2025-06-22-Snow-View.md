Over the past few years, while preparing for the [Patrouille des Glaciers](https://pdg.ch) and other ski mountaineering (skimo) races, I built a simple web tool to support my training.

The site displays live webcam images and weather data from several popular training spots in my local area. This makes it easy to check current conditions and decide whether a location is skiable—especially helpful during uncertain weather.

In addition to the live data, the site also compiles cumulative training statistics by sport type. One key feature is that it tracks winter sports activity by season rather than by calendar year—something that felt more relevant for skimo training. The data is pulled from [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), where I log all my activities.

That said, this feature has become somewhat redundant, since Strava now allows filtering by the past six months, which offers similar insights. Still, I find it handy for seasonal comparisons and quick overviews.
