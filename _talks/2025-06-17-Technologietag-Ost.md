I recently had the pleasure of presenting our transcription service — developed for Swiss German and many other languages — at OST (Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences).

The service is hosted at our university in Winterthur, enabling its use in privacy-sensitive contexts such as health-related interviews.

It was a great opportunity to share insights into our work and to discuss both the challenges and the potential of speech-to-text technologies in multilingual settings.

Many thanks to the team at OST for the warm welcome and the engaging conversations!
