Hi, I'm Flavio — a researcher at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init) at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Winterthur, Switzerland.
My current work focuses on applying speech-to-text technologies in various Swiss industries, with a particular focus on Swiss German. I'm also involved in several projects in the fields of AI and software engineering.

My Background and History
=====

I hold an MSc in Engineering (specializing in Computer Science) and a BSc in Electrical Engineering, both from [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering).

Before moving into academia, I worked as a senior software and automation engineer at [Bühler AG](https://www.buhlergroup.com) — an innovative and globally respected company in the field of advanced process engineering. My professional journey began there with an [apprenticeship in mechatronics](https://www.buhlergroup.com/global/de/purpose-community/next-generation/apprenticeships/uzwil/automatiker-in.html), where I focused on PLC software development.

Bühler remains a place I look back on fondly — not only for the technical challenges and strong engineering culture, but also for the people and purpose-driven environment. It's the kind of company I could imagine working with again in the future.

Beyond Research
=====

During my early years at Bühler, while working abroad on commissioning projects, I discovered my passion for endurance sports while spending the free time with my work mates. Over time, this interest led me to compete in numerous mountain bike marathons, including stage races like the Engadin Bike Giro and Rothaus Bike Giro, as well as the Nationalpark Bike Marathon.

Beyond mountain biking, I spend a lot of time on the road bike and cross-country skis — depending on the season.

In recent years, the team at [we2-coaching](https://www.we2-coaching.ch/) introduced me to ski mountaineering (skimo), which has led me to participate in several races, from vertical sprints to longer team competitions. To complement both my physical and technical abilities, I’ve also started climbing and bouldering.

Ultimately, one of my biggest motivations is to share Switzerland’s beautiful alpine landscapes with my kids and to teach them a respectful and mindful way of living with nature.
