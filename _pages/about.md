Hi! I'm Flavio, a researcher at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init) at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Winterthur, Switzerland. My current research centers on applying speech-to-text technologies across various Swiss industries, with an emphasis on Swiss German. Furthermore I'm involved in various AI and software engineering projects.

My Background and History
=====

I hold an MSc in Engineering with a focus on Computer Science and a BSc in Electrical Engineering, both from [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering).  Before transitioning to academia, I worked as a senior software and automation engineer at [Bühler AG](https://www.buhlergroup.com/global/en/homepage.html). At Bühler I also conducted my [apprenticeship in mechatronics](https://www.buhlergroup.com/global/de/purpose-community/next-generation/apprenticeships/uzwil/automatiker-in.html) with a focus on PLC software engineering.
