Hi, I'm Flavio — an AI and software engineering researcher at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init) at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Winterthur, Switzerland.
My current work focuses on applying speech-to-text technologies in various Swiss industries, with a particular focus on Swiss German. I'm also involved in several projects in the fields of AI and software engineering.

## My Background and History

I completed both my MSc in Engineering (specializing in Computer Science) and BSc in Electrical Engineering at [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering) through part-time studies, alongside my professional work at Bühler. My master thesis focused on performance testing and quality control in web applications.

### Automation

Before transitioning into academia, I worked as a senior software and automation engineer at [Bühler AG](https://www.buhlergroup.com) — an innovative and globally respected company in the field of advanced process engineering. During my time at Bühler, I gained experience across the full spectrum of plant automation.

My professional journey began with an [apprenticeship in mechatronics](https://www.buhlergroup.com/global/de/purpose-community/next-generation/apprenticeships/uzwil/automatiker-in.html). We built electrical control cabinets, learned the fundamentals of pneumatics, and worked hands-on with electric motors and sensors. In the final year, I specialized in PLC software development. A particular highlight was an interdisciplinary project completed entirely by apprentices, giving us full responsibility from concept to implementation.

After completing my mandatory military service, I worked as an automation engineer, taking part in numerous plant commissioning projects around the world—including in Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Portugal, and Switzerland.

From one day to the next, I had to learn how to:

- work in interdisciplinary and intercultural teams
- live independently in unfamiliar environments
- solve problems with limited support and equipment
- plan and setup entire network infrastructures on-site

### Software engineering

Later, I transitioned into SCADA programming, customizing plant control systems — an area where I could draw on my experience working directly with customers and operators. I also led several automation projects, coordinating efforts between PLC and SCADA engineers.

This eventually led to a senior software engineering role, where I worked in a team responsible for Bühler’s entire automation platform. Thanks to my ongoing studies, I became a valuable resource for introducing the latest engineering practices, and methodologies to the team. Among other contributions, I initiated the transition to a more modular application architecture—designed to remain maintainable by the medium-sized team and understandable for the engineering departments executing customer projects.

One of the most important (non-technical) lessons I learned during this time was that meaningful transformation requires patience, empathy, and buy-in from all stakeholders.

Bühler remains a place I look back on fondly — not only for the technical challenges and strong engineering culture, but also for the people and purpose-driven environment. It's the kind of company I could imagine working with again in the future.

## Beyond Research

During my early years at Bühler, while working abroad on commissioning projects, I discovered my passion for endurance sports while spending my free time with my workmates. Over time, this interest led me to compete in numerous mountain bike marathons, including stage races like the Engadin Bike Giro and Rothaus Bike Giro, as well as the Nationalpark Bike Marathon.

Beyond mountain biking, I spend a lot of time on the road bike and cross-country skis — depending on the season.

In recent years, the team at [we2-coaching](https://www.we2-coaching.ch/) introduced me to ski mountaineering (skimo), which has led me to participate in several races, from vertical sprints to longer team competitions. To complement both my physical and technical abilities, I’ve also started climbing and bouldering.

Ultimately, one of my biggest motivations is to share Switzerland’s beautiful alpine landscapes with my kids and to teach them a respectful and mindful way of living with nature.

Spending time outdoors provides a valuable balance to my daily office work—and often sparks new ideas and inspiration.
