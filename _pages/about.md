Hi, I'm Flavio — a researcher at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init) at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Winterthur, Switzerland.
My current work focuses on applying speech-to-text technologies in various Swiss industries, with a particular focus on Swiss German. I'm also involved in several projects in the fields of AI and software engineering.

My Background and History
=====

I hold an MSc in Engineering (specializing in Computer Science) and a BSc in Electrical Engineering, both from [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering).

Before moving into academia, I worked as a senior software and automation engineer at [Bühler AG](https://www.buhlergroup.com) — an innovative and globally respected company in the field of advanced process engineering. My professional journey began there with a [apprenticeship in mechatronics](https://www.buhlergroup.com/global/de/purpose-community/next-generation/apprenticeships/uzwil/automatiker-in.html), where I focused on PLC software development.

Bühler remains a place I look back on fondly — not only for the technical challenges and strong engineering culture, but also for the people and purpose-driven environment. It's the kind of company I could imagine working with again in the future.
